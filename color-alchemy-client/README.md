**Run `npm start`**

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### <b>Important Notes</b>

In this assignment, I try to not use any UI Library or React-DnD (React Drag and Drop Libary), even no CSS preprocessors.
Just with pure React, CSS, HTML5 and apply some React supported synthetic events to implement.
